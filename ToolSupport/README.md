### Clone

Before cloning this repository, please notice two things: first, this repository does not contain generated sources, and second, the Eclipse update site is hosted in the `gh-pages` branch. That being said, my advice is to clone each branch separately; this avoids compiling the sources everytime you checkout the `gh-pages` branch. Additionally, this makes cloning the `master` branch lighter.

To clone the `master` branch:
```bash
git clone -b "master" --single-branch https://github.com/unicesi/pascani
```
