description=openArchitectureWare (oAW) is a suite of tools and components assisting with model driven software development built upon a modular MDA/MDD generator framework implemented in Java supporting arbitrary import (design) formats, meta models, and output (code) formats.\n\ At the core there is a workflow engine allowing the definition of transformation workflows as well as a number of prebuilt workflow components that can be used for reading and instantiating models, checking them for constraint violations, transforming them into other models and then finally, for generating code.
